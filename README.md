### Machine Code Reverter with Register and Memory Monitor
This program consumes formatted binary machine code (ARM v8) and produces human-readable code.  The product is both printed to screen and written to the output file.  	In addition to the dissembled output file, there is also a simulated output file, wherein the contents of the registers and memory are updated with line read.

At professor's request, all classes are in one single file.

### How
From command line:

	python team6.py -i finaltest3_bin.txt -o finaltest3
	
Or to run another test case:

	python team6.py -i <--machine code file txt--> -o <--output files name->
